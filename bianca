# MY 41189 PORFOLIO REFLECTION

## week 2
### what did i learn today

- models are able to help us understand things as it give us a understanding and prediction of how system and such work
- the definition of a cog world and how we can see it in our everyday life where it can be complicated and somewhat fixed in a complicated system
- another new term i learnt is a bug world, how they are complex with their own thoughs and ideas as the moving parts in a system
- how we can broadly categorise systems as complex and complicated

## week 3
### what did i learn today

- models can predict and test the physcological power of an individual/ individuals
- economist use rational behaviour but this is limited because some people display irrational behaviour
- most models may make sense in theory but in the sense of practicallity the model may not be as efficent, effective or practical

## week 4
### what did i learn 

- system diagram (loop diagram) can how a system may function and the behaviour od the system can be roughly depicted in a behaviour diagram
- i now gained the knowledge of what truely is a system

## week 5
### what did i learn today

- team members made a group chat to communitcate during our group work presetation, group is alittle confused on what diagrams to use
- most events are no lineaar making it hard to used therefore regression can be used
- gained the insight of the linear graph is that it is at time unrealistic
- i didnt know that ABM where the most flexible and realsitic of them all
- strength in understanding regularities such as normal distribution and bell curves due to previouse knowledge obtained

## week 6
### what did i learn today and what did me and my team members do

- team member disscussed the assignments and the understanding of the first assignment
- assignments of the parts were assigned to each member
- team are confusd on which models to use
- concavity is fairly simple and easy to understand, i feel like its a strength
- weaknesses are understanding equalibrium, very complex and hard to understand personally

## week 7
### what did i learn today and what did me and my team members do

- start of the assignment, most team members working well
- learn't the term heterogenity and a intresting term to bundle a broad group into one
- lack of innovation can cause greater heterogity, intresting thing that never crossed my mind
- replicator equation is very confusing

## week 8
### what did i learn today and what did me and my team members do

- finishing up with the assignment before submitting and submitting it in 
-
